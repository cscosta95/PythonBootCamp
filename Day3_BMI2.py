#This is a BMI Calculator, the BMI is calculated by diving the weight by the height to an exponent of 2
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
bmi = weight / (height**2)
print(str(weight) + " รท " + "(" + str(height) + " x " + str(height) + ") = " + str(bmi))
if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi)}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi)}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi)}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi)}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi)}, you are clinically obese.")
